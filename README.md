# PutkaOS

PutkaOS is a rudimentary operating system created for fun by a group of Finnish hobbyists. The project died many years ago, but I've decided to put the code here in case someone wants to play with it.

It's not a real useful OS, but if you're interested in developing a x86 OS from scratch, maybe you can get some ideas from the source. If I remember correctly (as of 2023), the OS can read FAT and ext2 file systems and load specially-compiled ELF binaries, with system calls for memory allocation, some basic file operations and console IO. It has virtual memory and multi-tasking, but it's not in a stage where you can actually use it for anything practical.

Feel free to dig around, but don't ask any questions, I can't probably answer them anymore.
